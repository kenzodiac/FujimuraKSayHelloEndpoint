Program Description: This is a program that emulates the console project of the same name that we did during the coding combine. It's an API program that takes in a single string input from the user, and returns a greeting message.

Peer Review By: Manuel L., I really like how everything is formated, everything looks nice and neat, the code also looks really great and works really good, I went into postman to see if user input is working , and it works great, great job on the assignment :)

How To Instuctions:
1) Load the program into VSCode.
2) Start Debugging.
3) Copy Local Host URL from the console (e.g. "http://localhost:5264")
4) Open Postman program and paste the copied URL into a new workspace, with the "GET" input field.
5) Append the URL with "SayHelloEndpoint/Hello/{name}"
6) Replace "{name}" with the user's name, and hit the "Send" button to the right of the input field.
